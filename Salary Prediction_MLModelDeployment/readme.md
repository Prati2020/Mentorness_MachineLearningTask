Task 2  Completed as ML Intern Mentorness
Task :Salary Predictions of Data Professions 

Problem Statement :Salaries in the field of data professions vary widely based on factors such as experience, job role, and performance. Accurately predicting salaries for data professionals is essential for both job seekers and employers. 

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dived into the dataset, conduct comprehensive EDA, and unveil valuable insights about data professionals' salaries. EDA will involve data visualization, summary statistics, and identifying patterns in the data. 
2. Feature Engineering: Created new features or transform existing ones that can provide additional insights or improve model performance. Feature engineering might involve deriving features related to experience, job role, and performance.
 3. Data Preprocessing: Prepared the data for model training. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features as needed. 
4. Machine Learning Model Development: Trained various machine learning regression models to predict salaries. Experimented with different algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to find the best-performing model. 
5. Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of models using appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2squared (R2) score. Identifed the model that provides the most accurate salary predictions. 
6. ML Pipelines and Model Deployment: Created ML Pipelines to streamline the end-to-end machine learning process, from data preprocessing to model training. Additionally, deploy a model that can generate predictions for unseen data. 
7. Recommendations
